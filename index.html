            Although it looks like a kiddie's game, Splatoon 2 can be enjoyable for all ages. In this game, you play
            as an inkling or octoling who can use a variety of weapons to spray paint on your territory. You can use
            tools like paintbrushes, rollers, and machine guns to win the game against the other team. If you like
            multiplayer games, this is a great choice, as there are many stages and fun games modes that have personally
            kept me occupied for almost two thousand hours! This is a game exclusive to the switch though, but is worth 
            checking out if you have that console!
