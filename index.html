                    Although it looks like a kiddie's game, Splatoon 2 can be enjoyable for all ages. In this game, you
                    play as an inkling or octoling who can use a variety of weapons to spray paint on your territory.
                    You can
                    use tools like paintbrushes, rollers, and machine guns to win the game against the other team. If
                    you
                    like multiplayer games, this is a great choice, as there are many stages and fun games modes that
                    have
                    personally kept me occupied for almost two thousand hours! This is a game exclusive to the switch
                    though, but
                    is worth checking out if you have that console!

                    Valorant is a riot's new 5v5 character-based tactical FPS where precise gunplay meets unique agent
                    abilities.
                    This is is a team-based tactical shooter and first-person shooter set in the near future. Players

                    having five players
                    on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability

                    Hollow Knight is considered to be a Metroidvania title where most of the gameplay revolves around
                    back tracking
                    through the map, using new items and upgrades to traverse a little further each time.
                    It's a very well designed game and has probably over 40 hours of content to discover and unlock with
                    3 free dlcs making the game even more expansive.
                    So if your itching for a platformer with puzzles, combat, secrets, difficulty, and bugs, then this
                    might be the game for you!

                    The third installment in the Mother/Earthbound series, Mother 3 requires no playthrough of the
                    previous two games to understand its story,
                    though many elements do derive from the previous game in the series, Earthbound. As a story-driven
                    RPG with some rhythm game elements,
                    quirky enemies, gorgeous pixel-art landscapes, and a deep dive into the devastating effects of
                    corporate annexation on independent small nations,
                    Mother 3 holds up to this day as one of the most well-written, beautiful 2D RPGs of all time.
