    <pre style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" class="border">
            Although it looks like a kiddie's game, Splatoon 2 can be enjoyable for all ages. In this game, you play
            as an inkling or octoling who can use a variety of weapons to spray paint on your territory. You can use
            tools like paintbrushes, rollers, and machine guns to win the game against the other team. If you like
            multiplayer games, this is a great choice, as there are many stages and fun games modes that have personally
            kept me occupied for almost two thousand hours! This is a game exclusive to the switch though, but is worth 
            checking out if you have that console!

    <pre style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" class="border">
            Valorant is a riot's new 5v5 character-based tactical FPS where precise gunplay meets unique agent abilities. 
            This is is a team-based tactical shooter and first-person shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of agents, 
            characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world.
            In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players
            on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging
            through kills, deaths, or spike actions.

    <h3>Simon Vincini's <small>recommendation</small></h3>
    <h2 id="hollowKnight">Hollow Knight</h2>
    <img src="hollowKnight.jpg" alt="Hollow Knight" width=960 height=540>
    <pre style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;" class="border">
            Hollow Knight is considered to be a Metroidvania title where most of the gameplay revolves around back tracking
            through the map, using new items and upgrades to traverse a little further each time. It's a very well designed game and has probably over 
            40 hours of content to discover and unlock with 3 free dlcs making the game even more expansive. So if your itching for a platformer with puzzles, 
            combat, secrets, difficulty, and bugs, then this might be the game for you!
